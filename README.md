# Sign-In Best Parctice

This project demonstrate Sign-in form best practice.
base on web.dev Sign-in form best practices article.
link: https://web.dev/sign-in-form-best-practices/

brief summary:

1. use meaningful HTML elements: <form>, <input>, <label> and <button>.
2. Label every input with a <label>.
3. Use element attributes to access built-in browser features: type, name, autocomplete, required, autofocus.
4. Use name="new-password" for a sign-up password input and for the new password in a Change password form.
5. Use autocomplete="current-password" for a sign-in password input.
6. Don't use autocomplete for a new password.
7. Provide Show password functionality.
8. Use aria-label and aria-describedby for password inputs.
9. Don't double-up inputs.
10. Design forms so the mobile keyboard doesn't obscure inputs or buttons.
11. Ensure forms are usable on mobile: use legible text, and make sure inputs and buttons are large enough to work as touch targets.
12. Maintain branding and style on your sign-up and sign-in pages.
13. Test in the field as well as the lab: build page analytics, interaction analytics, and user-centric performance measurement into your sign-up and sign-in flow.
14. Test across browsers and devices: form behaviour varies significantly across platforms.
